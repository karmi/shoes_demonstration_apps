# Use a grid to generate a bubble-like composition.
# This example shows that a grid doesn't have to be rigid at all.
# It's very easy to breake loose from the coordinates NodeBox
# passes you, as is shown here. The trick is to add or subtract
# something from the x and y values NodeBox passes on. Here,
# we also use random sizes.

# We use a little bit of math to define the fill colors.
# Sinus and cosinus are not standard functions of NodeBox.
# Instead, they are in Python's math library. The next
# line imports those functions.
